# ARM64 Operating System

# NO FURTHER UPDATES PLANNED #

A minimal ARM64 operating system for QEMU with an interactive shell and 17 built-in commands.

## Project Overview

This project is a **proof of concept of AI capabilities** - a collaborative effort between human research and AI implementation, with all code written by **Claude Code** (claude.ai/code).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and run
make
./run.sh

# Exit QEMU: Ctrl+A, X
```

Try these commands in the shell:
